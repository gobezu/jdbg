Joomla! debugging tool compatible with version 2.5+

jdbg allows you to print in various formats and also enables you to set condition for the printing. You can direct the output to to a predefined log file which comes really useful in case you must do what you shouldn't normally do, namely debug on a live site.

_ 
jdbg::p($var);
simply prints $var with the printer assigned in jdbg plugin configuration

Ex 2. jdbg::p($var, $varCond, "re:[a-z]+");
prints $var with the printer assigned in jdbg plugin configuration only if $varCond matches the given regular expression of [a-z]+

Ex 3. jdbg::p($var, $varCond, jdbg::IS_EMPTY);
prints $var with the printer assigned in jdbg plugin configuration only if $varCond is empty (defined as not isset or != '')

Ex 4. jdbg::pf($var, 'area');
simply prints $var overriding the printer assigned in jdbg plugin configuration and uses instead textarea

You are able to print in the following formats:
* krumo (http://krumo.sourceforge.net) 
* kint (http://code.google.com/p/kint) 
* pre-formatted
* within a textarea
* using var_dump (good enough if you have xdebug in place)
* dump to log file
